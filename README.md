## Habit Book
A social media platform that allows a user to share their habit goals to promote consistency by allowing users and their followers to visualize days when a habit was performed. Users can follow other users and visit other user's pages to see how well others are doing on their habits. Users can like and comment on each other's habits. This is a full stack project exercising my knowledge in relational database design, RestAPI, and AJAX CRUD operations.
